       <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Highway traffic is a game designed to challenge users' mulitasking skills by testing their speed and reflex skills. In this high intensity game, players are challenged to race against the clock while also literally racing through a road of moving traffic. Players are to navigate through a busy highway while dodging other vehicles in traffic and striving to achieve high speed scores for more points. As all of this is happening, users must avoid collisions through the chaotic lane weaving.
