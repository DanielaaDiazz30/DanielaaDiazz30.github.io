<h2>What makes a hero?</h2>
<p>A hero is someone who is admired for their struggles, their success, and their uttermost efforts to fight for what they believe in and battle for what they stand for .</p>
<p> Jenni Rivera exemplifies that and so much more. She is an empowering and authentic role model who faught to be one of the first females to succeed in a male dominant industry at the time (music) She adovated for women, the LGBTQ community, immigrants and so much more while facing her own struggles as a mother and wife. As a latina myself, it is an honor to have her represent our community as she emobodies perseverance and strength. </p>.</p>
